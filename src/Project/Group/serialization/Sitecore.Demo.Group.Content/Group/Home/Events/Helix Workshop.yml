        Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.<br />
        <br />
        Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud.<br />
        <br />
        Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.<br />
        <br />
        You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting.<br />
        <br />
        Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.<br />
        <br />
        I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.<br />
        <br />
        But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.<br />
        <br />
        Batman may have made the front page but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.<br />
        <br />
        Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.<br />
        <br />
        I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I've had a change of heart. I don't want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let's give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn't dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.<br />
        <br />
        You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.<br />
        <br />
        Now choice is yours: exile or death?<br />
        <br />
        Search him. Then I will kill you.<br />
        <br />
        All creatures feel fear. Especially the scary ones.&nbsp;
